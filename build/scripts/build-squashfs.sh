# Stage 5a: Squash & Stitch, squashfs half (docs/BUILD_SYSTEM.md §3 Stage 5 /
# ROADMAP.md Phase 1 "SquashFS Packaging Scripts").
#
# Copies the kernel + initrd out to the ISO staging tree's /casper/ (grub
# loads these directly — standard casper ISO layout), then compresses the
# rest of $ROOTFS into filesystem.squashfs, excluding /boot (duplicated onto
# the ISO directly) and the *contents* of /proc, /sys, /dev, /tmp, /run
# (kernel/systemd-populated at boot; also defends against mksquashfs
# otherwise walking whatever happens to still be mounted there from the
# chroot stages — verified this happens in practice, not just theoretical).
#
# Deliberately excludes only contents (tmp/*), not the directories
# themselves: excluding the bare directory entirely (as an earlier version
# of this script did with plain `-e tmp`) meant chroot'd /tmp didn't exist
# at boot at all, breaking casper's post-hooks debconf cleanup (`mktemp -dt
# debconf.XXXXXX` failed with "No such file or directory") — which is what
# actually killed PID 1, not any casper-bottom hook (verified interactively
# via QEMU + break=casper-bottom).
