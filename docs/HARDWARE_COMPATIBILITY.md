# GallosOS Hardware & Firmware Compatibility Specification

This document defines the architectural hardware baseline, bootloader targets, and firmware security requirements for GallosOS.

To ensure maximum compatibility across diverse university lab environments and competitor laptops, GallosOS is engineered to support a wide spectrum of hardware—from legacy BIOS workstations to modern UEFI SecureBoot laptops.

---

## 1. Boot Firmware & Architecture

GallosOS uses a hybrid bootloader architecture designed to maximize boot compatibility across old and new host hardware.

### 1.1 Legacy BIOS (CSM) vs UEFI

- **Legacy BIOS (PC-BIOS / CSM):** Fully supported. The Live USB includes an `mbr.bin` and the `grub-pc` payload in the boot sector. This ensures compatibility with older university lab computers (pre-2015) that do not support UEFI.
- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface):** Fully supported. The Live USB includes an EFI System Partition (ESP) with `grub-efi-amd64` binaries, supporting modern 64-bit UEFI firmware natively.

### 1.2 The SecureBoot Advantage

Unlike legacy contest distributions (like HuronOS) that relied on patching custom, out-of-tree filesystem modules (AUFS) into the Linux kernel—which inherently breaks cryptographic signatures and forces organizers to manually disable SecureBoot on hundreds of laptops—**GallosOS fully supports UEFI SecureBoot out of the box.**

> [!WARNING]
> **The Legacy Firmware Risk:** The official *Manual de Instalación de Huron OS para Delegados Estatales y Competidores* (OMI 2023) explicitly mandated that delegates and contestants disable both **Secure Boot** and **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** in firmware. The manual accompanied this with a severe warning: disabling Secure Boot and TPM on modern Windows 11 laptops with BitLocker encryption active can trigger permanent boot failures, BitLocker recovery lockouts, and potential data loss.

GallosOS completely eliminates this hazard by leveraging:

1. **Canonical's Signed `shim` Bootloader:** Microsoft-trusted shim loads the GRUB bootloader.
2. **Canonical's Signed Linux Kernel:** We use the unmodified, upstream Ubuntu LTS kernel.
3. **In-Tree Kernel Modules by Default:** By adopting standard `overlayfs` (for the Live filesystem) and `nftables` (for the Anti-Cheat firewall) instead of third-party patches, the signed kernel never complains about tainted or unsigned modules **on the default image**. The one documented, explicit-opt-in exception is the proprietary GPU driver module described in § 1.3 below — everything else stays in-tree.

**Advantage:** Contestants can bring their personal Windows 11 laptops (which mandate SecureBoot) to a competition, plug in the provided GallosOS USB, and boot immediately without digging into BIOS security settings or risking BitLocker key lockouts.

### 1.3 Optional Proprietary GPU Drivers & MOK-Signed Kernel Taint

Some venues run discrete-GPU-only workstations — an Intel or AMD CPU with no integrated graphics paired with a dedicated NVIDIA card — where the open-source Nouveau driver (the in-tree, no-MOK-needed default; see `docs/COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS.md` § "Hardware Graveyard Test" for its existing legacy-hardware test coverage) may not deliver full performance for graphics-heavy work, video playback, or a modern GPU's initial silicon support. GallosOS documents an explicit, opt-in path to the proprietary NVIDIA driver for these cases via the `drivers/nvidia-proprietary` `.gsm` module (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § 4, item 2).

- **This is not part of the default image.** The unmodified-kernel, in-tree-modules guarantee in § 1.2 holds unless an organizer explicitly enables this module in `build.toml`/`gallos.toml`.
- **Kernel taint is unavoidable for this module:** the proprietary NVIDIA driver is an out-of-tree, closed-source DKMS module — loading it taints the kernel regardless of signing.
- **SecureBoot stays enforced via MOK, not disabled:** rather than requiring organizers to disable SecureBoot venue-wide (the huronOS-style fallback GallosOS otherwise avoids entirely), the module is signed with a GallosOS-controlled Machine Owner Key (MOK — see `docs/BUILD_SYSTEM.md` § 4 for how the build pipeline keeps this key stable across releases). The organizer enrolls that MOK **once per physical machine** via `mokutil --import` and the `MokManager` reboot prompt.
- **This enrollment is not lost on the next ephemeral boot.** MOK trust is stored in the machine's UEFI NVRAM — firmware-level storage on the motherboard, entirely separate from GallosOS's tmpfs-overlay root filesystem or which USB stick is inserted. A live-USB reboot wipes the OS overlay, not the firmware's key store, so a machine enrolled once continues loading the signed module on every future GallosOS boot (any USB, any release built with the same MOK) without re-enrollment.
- **No additional contest-integrity surface:** this module is graphics-only (kernel-level display driver), so it does not interact with the Contest-mode network lockdown or Anti-Cheat threat model described in `docs/ANTI_CHEAT_AND_SECURITY.md`.

## 2. Hardware Requirements Matrix

Because GallosOS uses an immutable SquashFS + OverlayFS architecture, its memory requirements depend strictly on the boot mode chosen by the organizer.

### 2.1 Standard Boot (Read-Only USB + Ephemeral RAM)

In this mode, the core OS resides compressed on the USB drive (mounted read-only). All system changes, logs, and contestant files are written exclusively to ephemeral RAM (`tmpfs`). **The USB drive is never written to during operation.**

- **Minimum CPU:** 64-bit AMD64 / x86_64 processor (Intel Core 2 Duo / AMD Athlon 64 X2 or newer).
- **Minimum RAM:** 4 GB (Recommended: 8 GB for heavy IDEs like IntelliJ or CLion, as all session data and modified files live in RAM).
  - **Documented rationale for keeping 4 GB (a deliberate divergence from huronOS):** huronOS's own docs (`docs/start/requirements.md`) recommend 8 GB minimum from direct field experience ("with 4 GiB you'll likely run out of memory with a bad programmed DP"). GallosOS keeps 4 GB as the floor because the *contestant's own program* is bounded independently of the OS: the 2024 ICPC World Finals Technical Notes state the judging sandbox "will allow allocation of up to 2GB of memory for your program," and individual problems commonly impose much tighter per-test memory limits (e.g. 256 MB is a typical single-problem constraint). A contest-legal solution cannot itself exhaust a 4 GB machine the way an unbounded local experiment (an unsubmitted `int dp[100000][100000];` during practice, which huronOS's warning is really about) can. 4 GB remains the floor for lighter IDEs (VSCodium, Geany); the existing 8 GB *recommendation* still stands for IntelliJ/CLion-heavy setups.
- **Storage:** 16 GB+ USB Flash Drive.
  - **Quality & Read Speed Warning:** Organizers **must** use recognized, high-quality brands (e.g., SanDisk, Kingston, Samsung). Cheap promotional USB drives suffer from severe read bottlenecks and thermal throttling, causing the OS to freeze completely when loading heavy IDEs like IntelliJ or CLion into RAM.
  - **USB-C Recommendation:** Whenever possible, use USB-C / USB 3.2 Gen 1 drives. USB-C ports on modern laptops generally offer superior, sustained read bandwidth and avoid legacy USB 2.0 internal hub bottlenecks, drastically reducing IDE loading times.

### 2.2 `toram` Boot (RAM-Resident Disconnected Execution)

GallosOS supports the `toram` boot parameter. During early boot, the entire SquashFS OS image is copied directly into system RAM. The USB drive can then be physically unplugged.

- **Minimum CPU:** 64-bit AMD64 / x86_64 processor.
- **Minimum RAM:** 16 GB. (The OS payload of ~4.5 GB consumes RAM immediately, leaving ~11.5 GB for the desktop, compilers, and IDEs).
- **Design Target:** Eliminates USB NAND read bottlenecks after boot by executing all binary payloads directly from system memory.

### 2.3 GPU / Display Adapter

- **Default (no `drivers/nvidia-proprietary` module):** any GPU with in-tree kernel support renders via Nouveau (NVIDIA) or the standard `amdgpu`/`i915`/`xe` drivers (AMD/Intel) — no additional configuration required.
- **Modern Silicon & Driver Acceleration vs Legacy `fbdev` Anti-Patterns:**
  - In predecessor contest distributions (such as huronOS alpha 0.4, which was pinned to a custom Linux 6.0 kernel), booting on modern hardware (e.g. Intel Arrow Lake / Lunar Lake `8086:7d67` or NVIDIA RTX 40-series Ada Lovelace GPUs) resulted in DRM initialization crashes or black screens. This forced organizers in production deployments (such as the UAA ICPC Gran Premio laboratories, documented in [`CPC-GALLOS/icpc-gpm-uaa-huronos`](https://github.com/CPC-GALLOS/icpc-gpm-uaa-huronos)) to blacklist DRM drivers, fall back to the unaccelerated EFI Framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`), inject missing Debian `fbdev_drv.so` modules, and force CPU-bound software rendering (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` via Mesa LLVMpipe).
  - GallosOS completely avoids this performance bottleneck by building on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Kernel 6.8+ / 6.11 HWE)** and native **Wayland (Labwc)**, delivering native hardware DRM/KMS acceleration out of the box across all modern Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA silicon.
- **Discrete-GPU-only machines (no integrated graphics):** a CPU with no iGPU has no fallback if its only GPU's driver fails to load — unlike a hybrid-graphics laptop, which degrades to onboard graphics. Organizers deploying such machines (e.g. an Intel CPU with no iGPU paired with a dedicated NVIDIA card) should verify the display path before contest day, whether relying on Nouveau or opting into § 1.3's proprietary driver module.
- **Proprietary driver module (opt-in):** see § 1.3 for the MOK-signing/SecureBoot mechanics. No specific driver-version-to-GPU-generation compatibility matrix is published here yet — that requires empirical validation per hardware generation, which has not been performed.

## 3. Peripheral & Network Compatibility

- **Displays:** Wayland natively supports fractional scaling and multi-monitor setups.
- **Keyboards:** The `gallos.toml` directive automatically provisions the correct keyboard layouts (`latam`, `us`, `es`, `br-abnt2`, `dvorak`), which contestants can toggle instantly via `Super + Space` (or `Alt + Shift`) and the Waybar status bar.

### 3.1 Networking & The Broadcom (`b43` / `wl`) BYOD Dilemma

In BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) competitive programming events (such as university training camps or club meetings), legacy laptops with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips (e.g., BCM4311, BCM4318, BCM4322, BCM4331, BCM4360) present a classic Linux distribution challenge:

1. **The Redistribution Limitation:**
   - While modern Broadcom chips (`brcmfmac`) have legally redistributable firmware included in standard `linux-firmware`, legacy Broadcom cards (`b43` / `wl`) require proprietary microcode that Broadcom's EULA forbids redistributing in public Linux ISO images.
2. **GallosOS Pragmatic Approach for BYOD:**
   - **Open-Source Firmware Inclusion (`openfwwf`):** GallosOS pre-bundles `firmware-b43-openfwwf` (Open Source Firmware for IEEE 802.11 Devices), providing legal out-of-the-box support for basic 802.11b/g Broadcom chips (BCM4306, BCM4311, BCM4318, BCM4320).
   - **Modern Broadcom Support (`brcmfmac`):** Modern 802.11ac/ax chips (BCM4350, BCM4356, etc.) operate out of the box via standard in-tree `linux-firmware`.
   - **Help Desk Operational Fallback (Recommended):** For BYOD events with legacy laptops bearing unsupported Broadcom hardware, organizers should keep a small pool of standard USB Ethernet adapters or USB Wi-Fi dongles (e.g., MediaTek `mt76` / Realtek `rtw88` chipsets, which use in-tree redistributable firmware) at the technical support desk.

### 3.2 Enterprise & Campus Wi-Fi in BYOD Contexts (IEEE 802.1X / WPA-Enterprise)

While official championship laboratories (such as ICPC World Finals or Onsite Regionals) typically mandate wired Ethernet (LAN) for fixed workstations, **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments** — including university training camps (e.g. Training Camp México / TCMX), weekly club practice, and campus invitationals — rely almost exclusively on student laptops connecting via campus wireless networks (such as university 802.1X SSIDs like UAA's `RIUAA` or worldwide `eduroam`).

1. **The Legacy ConnMan BYOD Failure Mode:**
   - Predecessor distributions relying on ConnMan (`cmst`) fail on enterprise wireless networks because ConnMan's tray applet cannot present interactive EAP credential dialogs (PEAP, MSCHAPv2, TTLS), resulting in runtime connection errors (*"IEEE8021x secured services have to be manually configured"*). As documented during live student deployments in [`CPC-GALLOS/icpc-gpm-uaa-huronos`](https://github.com/CPC-GALLOS/icpc-gpm-uaa-huronos), this created severe friction for BYOD contestants unless organizers manually wrote root-level INI files in `/var/lib/connman/*.config` via the CLI or fell back to mobile phone hotspots.
2. **GallosOS Enterprise Architecture for BYOD & Labs:**
   - **Interactive GUI Support:** GallosOS adopts **NetworkManager**, providing native graphical credential prompts for PEAP, MSCHAPv2, TTLS, and TLS client certificates directly from the Wayland desktop applet on any contestant's personal laptop.
   - **Declarative Pre-Provisioning (`gallos.toml`):** Organizers hosting BYOD camps can declare campus Wi-Fi profiles directly inside `gallos.toml` (`[network.wifi_profiles]`), enabling automated, zero-touch wireless authentication across hundreds of student machines without requiring contestants to configure enterprise security settings manually.

## 4. Mass Flashing Hardware (`gallos-flash`)

When preparing for a contest, organizers often need to flash 50+ USB drives simultaneously using the `gallos-flash` utility. Writing a 4.5 GB OS image to multiple drives concurrently requires significant electrical power and I/O bandwidth.

To avoid catastrophic write failures or extremely slow flashing times (e.g., 4+ hours), follow these hardware guidelines for your "flashing station":

1. **Externally Powered USB Hubs (Mandatory):** Never use a cheap, unpowered USB hub to flash multiple drives. The combined power draw of writing to 10 USBs simultaneously will exceed a standard motherboard port's power limit, causing drives to disconnect randomly during the flash. Always use an **Active USB 3.0+ Hub with a dedicated AC power adapter** (Recommended brands: Anker, Sabrent, TP-Link).
2. **Dedicated PCIe Expansion Cards (Desktops):** If you are using a desktop PC as a flashing station, the best approach is to install a dedicated PCIe to USB 3.2 expansion card (Recommended brands: StarTech, Inateck, Orico). Unlike external hubs that share a single port's bandwidth, PCIe cards connect directly to the CPU's PCIe lanes, avoiding the shared-bandwidth bottleneck so each port can approach full write speed independently (actual throughput still depends on the USB drives themselves).
3. **Thunderbolt / USB-C Hub Topology (Laptops):** If flashing from a laptop, plug your powered USB hub into a **Thunderbolt 3/4 or USB-C** port rather than a traditional rectangular USB-A port. Thunderbolt ports have massive bandwidth (up to 40 Gbps) compared to standard USB-A (5 Gbps), preventing the hub from becoming a severe data bottleneck when flashing 10+ drives at once.

## 5. CPU Execution Determinism & Thermal Throttling Prevention

In competitive programming, contestants rely on accurate local execution timings when benchmarking complex algorithms against maximum test cases ($N = 10^5, 2 \times 10^5$). On modern multi-core laptops, dynamic frequency scaling (Intel Turbo Boost, AMD Core Performance Boost) and thermal throttling introduce non-deterministic execution spikes, causing identical code to take 0.8s on one run and 2.1s on another.

Inspired by proven production practices from the **ICPC World Finals Systems Operations team** ([`icpcsysops/ansible`](./COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS.md#9-specialized-analysis-icpc-world-finals--nac-sysops-fleet-orchestration-icpcsysopsansible)), GallosOS incorporates declarative hardware stabilization mechanisms:

### 5.1 Dynamic Boost Disabling & Fixed Performance Governor

During `Contest` mode (or declaratively via `[system.hardware]`), `gallos-daemon` configures kernel CPU frequency interfaces:

- **Intel Processors (`intel_pstate`):**

  ```bash
  # Disable dynamic overclocking / boost spikes
  echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
  # Pin performance bounds to base non-overclocked clock
  echo 100 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/min_perf_pct
  echo 100 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct
  ```

- **AMD Processors (`cpufreq`):**

  ```bash
  # Disable AMD Core Performance Boost
  echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost
  ```

- **Frequency Governor:**
  Sets `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor` to `performance`, preventing powersave downclocking transitions during interactive idle pauses between compile runs.

### 5.2 HyperThreading Sibling Thread Isolation & CPU Pinning

On laptops where concurrent background threads or thermal budgets impact single-threaded algorithmic performance:

1. **Virtual Sibling Thread Deactivation:**
   Optionally offlines logical HyperThreading pairs (`echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<N>/online`), ensuring contestant processes execute strictly on dedicated physical cores with full L1/L2 cache allocation.
2. **Process Affinity Pinning (`taskset`):**
   GallosOS run-wrapper utilities (`runc`, `runcpp`, `runpython3`, `runjava`, `runkotlin`) support pinning execution to specific isolated physical CPU cores via `taskset -c <core>`, eliminating context switching and scheduler migration jitter.
